# CKY for CFG parsing
In this project we use the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm for bottom-up large-scale context-free grammar (CFG) parsing using Python and NLTK, applying it to the word and the parsing problem
of English. The ingredients are: the grammar, the test sentences, and the parser; using NLTK only to represent grammars and trees. The grammar stems from a project dealing with implementing spoken lan-
guage processing systems in the airline industry { the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS). The ATIS CFG is available in the NLTK data package, together with 98 test sentences.
